# learnLanguages

A friend wanted to learn Russian, but he didnt like any of the existing apps/webpages he found, so I decided to code this for him. To get started, install node if you dont have it, clone the repo, cd into it and run
```
npm ci
```
to install the dependencies, then execute 
```
npm run exec
```
and the webpage will be running on localhost, port 8080, you can access it using your favourite web browser!
